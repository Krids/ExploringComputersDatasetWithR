If you do not have R installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of R, which already has the above packages and more included.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `ExploringComputersDatasetWithR/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following file:

```bash
script.R

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
